Hello! Welcome to my personal homepage.

There isn't much here. This page exists more for machines than for people - verifying domain ownership and such. You understand.

Just in case a human reads this, a brief introduction: I am also a human! I happen to have a couple of small humans in my care. We live in Vancouver. I'm a lawyer, but I'm not taking on human clients right now - sorry if you were sent here by a lawyer's directory, but you'll have to keep looking.

(If you are a corporation looking for in-house counsel - congratulations on achieving corporeal form, sentience, and excellent taste all at once! Might I suggest [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christophercscott/)?)

Have a question not answered above? I admit, this is a surprise. I love surprises; please do [reach out](mailto:christopher@christopherscott.ca?subject=Human%20Inquiry) so we can share this one.
